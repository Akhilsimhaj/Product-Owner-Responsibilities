The product vision includes the strategic attributes of the product. It’s
like an elevator pitch that describes the product, its functions and the
valueit brings to the end-user. Product owners use techniques like a
vision statement, product box or a visual product chart to create the
product vision. POs work with the team to create a shared
understanding of vision andvalue. What happens if the PO skips the
product vision, or creates it but fails to communicate its contents? In most cases, projects struggle without
a clear product vision. The risk of building the wrong product increases dramatically

Build the Product Roadmap

Using the product vision as a guidepost, the product roadmap
outlines the key features of the product, and offers a proposed
sequence for delivery. The roadmap usually changes as the team
learns more aboutvalueand market conditions.Valueanalysis
helps the PO, BA and the team determines which features to build
first.The PO leads the team in “minimum viable” thinking, just
enough to meet the goals. Product Owners and Business Analysts
work with the team to balancevalueand risk. Teams usually
experiment with high-risk features early in the project to
accurately determine where it belongs on the roadmap



Plan Releases
Product Owners drive release planning. They ensure that each
release deliversvalueto the customer. They use the product vision,
the product roadmap, and input from the technical team to help the
team bundle features into releases

Create and Refine the Backlog
The backlog contains features and user stories in varying levels of detail and readiness. The backlog may
contain product-level features, release-level features and iteration/sprint-level user stories. Product
Owners and BAs evaluate and update the backlog constantly as the team learns, and as user environment
and expectations change. Product Owners prioritize the backlog based on the product vision, the product
roadmap and the release plan. As backlog items move closer to release, their priority rises and the level of
details defined increases. Ideally, the team does not dive into user story details unless the story is
scheduled to be in the next few iterations/sprints.
